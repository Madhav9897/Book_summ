var top_content ={"Think And Grow Rich":"By telling yourself over and over and over again, that it is possible for you to achieve your goals, that you can make your dreams a reality, and that you have to go your own way and can’t let anyone interfere with it, you form these beliefs in your subconscious. This builds not only the confidence you need to follow through on your actions, but also lets your goals seep into the unconscious part of your brain, until you automatically align all of your actions in a way that leads you towards your goals.But what else can you use this belief that could move mountains for?","Thinking Fast And Slow":"Kahneman labels the 2 systems in your mind as follows. System 1 is automatic and impulsive. It’s the system you use when someone sketchy enters the train and you instinctively turn towards the door and what makes you eat the entire bag of chips in front of the TV when you just wanted to have a small bowl.System 1 is a remnant from our past, and it’s crucial to our survival. Not having to think before jumping away from a car when it honks at you is quite useful, don’t you think? System 2 is very conscious, aware and considerate.It helps you exert self-control and deliberately focus your attention. This system is at work when you’re meeting a friend and trying to spot them in a huge crowd of people, as it helps you recall how they look and filter out all these other people. System 2 is one of the most ‘recent’ additions to our brain and only a few thousand years old. It’s what helps us succeed in today’s world, where our priorities have shifted from getting food and shelter to earning money, supporting a family and making many complex decisions.However, these 2 systems don’t just perfectly alternate or work together. They often fight over who’s in charge and this conflict determines how you act and behave.","Sapiens":"Harari's main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights. He argues that these beliefs give rise to discrimination – whether that be racial, sexual or political and it is potentially impossible to have a completely unbiased society. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions – owe their emergence to Sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[5] Accordingly, Harari regards money as a system of mutual trust and sees political and economic systems as more or less identical with religions. Harari's key claim regarding the Agricultural Revolution is that while it promoted population growth for Sapiens and co-evolving species like wheat and cows, it made the lives of most individuals (and animals) worse than they had been when Sapiens were mostly hunter-gatherers, since their diet and daily lives became significantly less varied. Humans' violent treatment of other animals is a theme that runs throughout the book. In discussing the unification of humankind, Harari argues that over its history, the trend for Sapiens has increasingly been towards political and economic interdependence. For centuries, the majority of humans lived in empires, and capitalist globalization is effectively producing one, global empire. Harari argues that money, empires, and universal religions are the principal drivers of this process.Harari sees the Scientific Revolution as founded on innovation in European thought, whereby elites became willing to admit to, and hence to try to remedy, their ignorance. He sees this as one driver of early modern European imperialism and of the current convergence of human cultures. Harari also emphasises the lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not significantly happier than in past eras.[6] He concludes by considering how modern technology may soon end the species as we know it, as it ushers in genetic engineering, immortality, and non-organic life. Humans have, in Harari's chosen metaphor, become gods: they can create species."}

var happy_content = {"The Art Of Happiness By Dalai Lama":"Happy people have it a lot better than unhappy people. Studies show you’re more likely to pick up a better mate, more satisfying marriages, more likely to be a better parent, better immune system and live an extra 10 years. It also leads to better mental resilience and ability to deal with adversity or trauma. In the workplace, happy individuals perform much better and earn much more, than miserable employees watching the minutes tick throughout the day. These happy employees are more productive, loyal and take less sickies.The Art of Happiness looks at happiness through different perspectives from two different authors. Firstly, the Western perspective from Howard Cutler, a relatively no-name psychiatrist out of the US. And the 14th Dalai Lama (The Dal from here on in), leader in Tibetan Buddhism and bringing the perspective from the east. Although perspectives differ, they attempt to drill things down to the basic human level. Here the little distinctions like gender, race, religion, culture and language don’t matter. There are similarities that all of us share in being part of the human race.Buddhism doesn’t seem to be relevant to us in the Western world. It seems to be only for those wild monks who are willing to give up iPhones and Pizza to hang out in a cave for a few decades. But if you look at the fundamentals of their beliefs, it seems like they’re onto something. Buddhism is very different to Western religions. It isn’t a faith based system; the Buddha recommends that nobody blindly accepts his teachings. Rather, you should investigate the validity of it all, test the method for yourself and discard anything that looks like crap. So for the last 2500 years, Buddhists have been practicing techniques to train the mind and develop inner resources and been willing to discard what appears to be BS. Over time, they’re left with only the gold, the things that might be objectively true about human existence. More recently, Western science has validated what the Buddhists have been claiming for millennia.","Ikigai":"secret to longevity is avoiding stress. In fact, premature aging has been linked to stress in a number of scientific studies, since stressors produce undue wear and tear on the body and the mind. For instance, in a study done at Heidelberg University a series of strenuous job interviews were administered to an aspiring young doctor, during which he was asked to solve complex mathematical equations. When his blood was then sampled, it indicated that the stress of the interview had caused the release of antibodies, as if he had been infected by a virus or bacteria. If such a threat had existed, this immune response would be essential to wiping it out – but antibodies also attack healthy cells, leading the body to age faster than it should. Therefore, reducing stress is key to living a long life and you can do it in a number of pleasant ways. Just try practicing mindfulness, doing yoga or taking time to exercise, all of which give you a chance to calm down and observe your body and mind more closely."};

Murphy shares the story of a salesman, who never seemed to receive any recognition at work. Despite outperforming all of his colleagues, he didn’t rise in the ranks. As it turned out, he suspected his boss to not like him. Therefore, he subconsciously behaved in somewhat hostile ways himself. Once he changed his own attitude, wishing genuine success for his boss, he soon received a promotion. Many rich people share the belief at the root of this story: if you secretly despise others for having something you want, you’ll make it less likely for yourself to attain that thing. Take wealth, for example. If you think money is the root of all evil and that all millionaires are crooks, how do you think that’ll affect the management of your own finances?"

var psycho_content = {"Range":"Range, a book about the value of being a generalist rather than a lifelong or career-long specialist, argues that many of the most effective people in elite professional fields (such as sports, art, and scientific research) succeed not despite the fact but because they find their way to that particular field after pursuing other endeavors first. The concept of parenting, particularly the guidance and gatekeeping of children’s hobbies and interests, seems to consistently hover just outside the page margins—because it’s hard to argue that anyone plays a more vital role in overseeing people’s academic, artistic, and athletic pursuits early in life than their parents. As Epstein put it in an interview with me, “Before this was even a book idea, I was interested in [early childhood] specialization, particularly in sports. And you cannot interact with that area without parents being front and center.” Range’s primary takeaways for parents are both clear and counterintuitive to contemporary parenting wisdom: Let kids find out on their own that they’re passionate about something, and let them quit and pursue something else when they find out they aren’t.","Thinking Fast And Slow":"Kahneman labels the 2 systems in your mind as follows.
